# Welcome to Fresh

* Fresh is an iOS app that makes it easy to connect people with anyone who sells fresh things around the world.
* People can see where sellers are located on the map and buy high quality food.
* Consumers can have great experiences by visiting farmhouses and doing activities.
* Farmers, greengrocers, florists and butchers can form and join small markets in just a few taps, and you can join them!

Fresh is a non-profit app that hasn't launched to the App Store yet. Everyone is encouraged to collaborate.

#### TODO list:
* <strike>Add small custom pins to the map</strike>
* <strike>Make small pins display the title of the products farmers are selling</strike>
* When those small custom pins are tapped, a bigger view pops up showing the user even more information.
* Add a chat feature to the app, so that farmers can chat with consumers (shall we use SupportKit?)
* Fix the search bar and allow users to search the products they want, and then display them on the map.
